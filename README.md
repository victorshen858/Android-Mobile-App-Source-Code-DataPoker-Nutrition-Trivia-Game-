# Android App Course Project

**Contribution:** As Lead Developer, I programmed the user interface and coded the majority of app features/activities. 

**App Description:** This is a mobile app that seeks to educate users about the nutritional value of common foods found in their diet. The goal of the app is to debunk any myths they may have regarding certain foodsâ€™ nutritional value and get the users to start re-evaluating their mental model of the world and hopefully switch to a healthier, more nutritious diet!

**Instructions:** To run the app, please download the .apk file and install it on your device. The file can be found under app/build/outputs/apk/ and is called app-debug.apk
