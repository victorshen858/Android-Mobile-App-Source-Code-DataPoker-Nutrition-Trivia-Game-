# Android Mobile Application Game : Data Poker Nutritional Trivia! Game

**Contribution:** As Lead Developer on a team of three developers (Victor Shen, Kai Johnson and Chris Lee), I programmed the user interface, game algorithms, data structures, and coded the majority of app features/activities. 

**App Description:** This is a mobile app that seeks to educate users about the nutritional value of common foods found in their diet. The goal of the app is to debunk any myths they may have regarding certain foodsâ€™ nutritional value and get the users to start re-evaluating their mental model of the world and hopefully switch to a healthier, more nutritious diet!

**Instructions:** To run the app, please download the app-debug.apk file and install it on your Android phone or tablet device. The file is located under Android App Source Code/app/build/outputs/apk/ 

**Source Code:** Java class and app activity files can be found in AndroidAppCourseProject/Android App Source Code/app/src/main/java/gmu/cs/cs477/
